#### 6.2 Code Snippets with Explanations

**1. Authentication Middleware**
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const auth = async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        const token = req.header('Authorization').replace('Bearer ', '');
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        req.user = decoded;
        next();
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(401).send({ error: 'Please authenticate.' });
    }
};

module.exports = auth;
```
This middleware handles JWT authentication for protected routes.

**2. Shopping Cart Logic**
```javascript
const updateCart = async (userId, productId, quantity) => {
    try {
        const cart = await Cart.findOne({ userId });
        const product = await Product.findById(productId);
        
        if (!cart) {
            // Create new cart if doesn't exist
            return await Cart.create({
                userId,
                items: [{ productId, quantity }]
            });
        }

        // Update existing cart
        const itemIndex = cart.items.findIndex(
            item => item.productId.toString() === productId
        );

        if (itemIndex > -1) {
            cart.items[itemIndex].quantity = quantity;
        } else {
            cart.items.push({ productId, quantity });
        }

        return await cart.save();
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error('Error updating cart');
    }
};
```
This code handles shopping cart updates with proper error handling.

**3. Payment Integration**
```javascript
const createPayment = async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { amount, currency, orderId } = req.body;
        
        const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
            amount: amount * 100, // Convert to cents
            currency,
            metadata: { orderId }
        });

        res.status(200).json({
            clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret
        });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({
            error: 'Error creating payment intent'
        });
    }
};
```
This code demonstrates Stripe payment integration.
